# MSNPClient
MSNPClient is a .NET Standard API that connects to MSN / Windows Live Messenger.

Since Microsoft shut down the MSN/WLM servers, it's used mostly to connect to [Escargot]("https://escargot.log1p.xyz")'s servers.

## Source and contributors
Source code is available on [GitHub]("https://github.com/Animadoria/MSNPClient").

Animadoria is the main contributor at the moment.

Thanks to walkingphasers and his [collection of documentation]("https://gitlab.com/escargot-chat/server/-/wikis/protocol-docs");

## Current state
MSNPClient is very much a work in progress. It can only connect, set presence and change the user's nickname at the moment. More to come!
